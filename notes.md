### 1. **First Band (First Significant Figure):**
   - This band represents the first significant figure of the resistance value.
   - Each color corresponds to a digit:
     - Black: 0
     - Brown: 1
     - Red: 2
     - Orange: 3
     - Yellow: 4
     - Green: 5
     - Blue: 6
     - Violet: 7
     - Gray: 8
     - White: 9

### 2. **Second Band (Second Significant Figure):**
   - This band represents the second significant figure of the resistance value.
   - The same color-to-digit mapping as the first band applies.

### 3. **Third Band (Multiplier):**
   - This band represents the multiplier or the power of 10 by which the first two digits should be multiplied.
   - Each color corresponds to a power of 10:
     - Black: \(10^0\) (1)
     - Brown: \(10^1\) (10)
     - Red: \(10^2\) (100)
     - Orange: \(10^3\) (1,000)
     - Yellow: \(10^4\) (10,000)
     - Green: \(10^5\) (100,000)
     - Blue: \(10^6\) (1,000,000)
     - Violet: \(10^7\) (10,000,000)
     - Gray: \(10^8\) (100,000,000)
     - White: \(10^9\) (1,000,000,000)

### 4. **Fourth Band (Tolerance):**
   - This band represents the tolerance, which indicates the allowable deviation from the specified resistance value.
   - Gold: ±5%
   - Silver: ±10%
   - No color: ±20%

### 5. **Optional Fifth Band (Temperature Coefficient):**
   - Some resistors may have a fifth band indicating the temperature coefficient, which describes how the resistance changes with temperature.
   - Colors include brown, red, orange, yellow, and blue, each corresponding to a different temperature coefficient.
