# 5 bands 
if there are 5 bands there are the 3 values for the start of the resistor
exmaple first val = 2, second = 3, third = 4, fourth = multiplier = 10, fifth = tolerance = 10%
== 2340 +- 10%
## Steps
1. make seperate functions for 4 bands and 5 bands
2. prompt for number of bands
3. if 4 do normal
4. if 5 do new
